# Video-Game-EDA-and-Prediction
This program performs some exploratory data analysis and sales prediction on the 'Video_Games_Sales_as_at_22_Dec_2016.csv' dataset on Kaggle. I will be using a dataset containing more than 16,000 video game entries, running an analysis over the data, and attempt to predict sales using various regressions and features such as genre, reviews, and user scores. \
The regressions used are Linear, Lasso, and XGB Regression.
